## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14.x or later recommended)
- `npm` or `yarn`

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/oh-my-dentist-peru.git
    cd oh-my-dentist-peru
    ```

2.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
    or if you use yarn:
    ```sh
    yarn install
    ```

### Environment Variables

The contact form uses EmailJS to function. You will need to create an `.env` file in the root of the project and add your EmailJS credentials.

1.  Create a file named `.env` in the project root:

    ```
    touch .env
    ```

2.  Add your EmailJS keys to the `.env` file. You can find these in your EmailJS account dashboard under "Email Services" and "Account".
    ```env
    REACT_APP_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
    REACT_APP_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id
    REACT_APP_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
    ```
    _Note: If you've hardcoded these values in your `Contacto.js` file, you can skip this step. However, using an `.env` file is the recommended and more secure practice._
